What transformations and actions would you use in each case? Complete the command with the appropriate transformations and actions.

1.	How do you see the first element of the inputRDD? auctionRDD.____________________

2.	What do you use to see the first 5 elements of the RDD? auctionRDD.____________________

3.	What is the total number of bids?

val totbids = auctionRDD.__________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

4.	What is the total number of distinct items that were auctioned?

val totitems = auctionRDD._________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

5.	What is the total number of item types that were auctioned?

val totitemtype = auctionRDD.______________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

6.	What is the total number of bids per item type?

val bids_itemtype = auctionRDD.____________________________________

___________________________________________________________________



We want to calculate the max, min and average number of bids among all the auctioned items.

7.	Create an RDD that contains total bids for each auction.

val bidsAuctionRDD = auctionRDD.___________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

8.	Across all auctioned items, what is the maximum number of bids? (HINT: you can use Math.max – in which case import java.lang.Math at the command line)

val maxbids = bidsItemRDD._________________________________________

9.	Across all auctioned items, what is the minimum number of bids?

val minbids = bidsItemRDD

10.	What is the average number of bids?

val avgbids = bidsItemRDD._________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
